a webpage displaying my Curriculum Vitae.
I am aware of how important it is to make a great first impression. We live in a time of intense 
competition and the fight for every available job opportunity is a fight for our very lives. You will 
read numerous motivational letters and impressive resumes that relay just how hardworking 
each candidate is, however, I hope that after going through my resume website, you will allow 
me the opportunity to impress you with not only my personality but my learned skillset as well.  
I believe that my strong motivation to learn and improve on my skills makes me a suitable 
candidate. As seen in the enclosed resume, I have deep interest in the work done by your 
organization. My approach to each challenge is to face it head on with all the fire within me, 
because if I am not giving my all then I am only cheating myself out of the best opportunity life 
has to offer â€“ and this job opportunity is exactly that, an opportunity to gain experience and 
learn. I am eager to improve my skills and am fully prepared to adapt myself to the new working 
environment while adding my own flair to every task assigned to me.
